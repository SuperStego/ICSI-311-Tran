This is a project I did where the goal was to implement a language definition.

This language definition is within the "Tran Language Definition.pdf" file with a few changes such as how accessor and mutators did not need full functionality and the built in getDate() method is not implemented.


There were different sections, marked by the different names of the zip files. 

I apologize for how terribly kept this repo is, but I had no idea how github worked when I was first using it.


The best version is Interpreter1.3 where code can be written as a string and then sent through the lexer, parser and then interpreter.

(there are a good amount of examples within the InterpreterTests and MyInterpreterTests classes)
